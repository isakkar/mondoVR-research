        <h3>Conversational AI Agents in Education</h3>
        <p>
            The results show that conversational AI agents have undergone a major evolution with the emergence of neural models and large language models (LLMs).
            These advances enable more natural, dynamic, and context-aware interactions, making virtual agents more realistic and engaging for learners.
            In educational settings, conversational agents are mainly used as tutors or learning assistants, achieving learning outcomes broadly comparable to those of human tutors.
            However, their strongest impact lies more in learner engagement than in raw performance.
            Studies report increased active participation, richer cognitive exchanges between students, and stronger involvement in collaborative tasks.
            Nevertheless, effects on productivity and performance remain limited and highly dependent on the quality of the agent’s pedagogical and technical design.

        <h3>Emotional Feedback from AI Agents in VR Language Learning</h3>
        <p>
            The findings of this systematic review indicate that emotional feedback provided by conversational agents in VR can play a key role in learner motivation and engagement.
            Agents capable of adapting their tone, expressing empathy, or encouraging users help reduce language-learning anxiety and strengthen learner confidence.
            However, the synthesis of existing studies reveals that few works directly and quantitatively assess the impact of emotional feedback.
            Most research adopts broad AI or VR perspectives without precisely measuring emotional effects.
            The results therefore highlight strong pedagogical potential, alongside a lack of methodological standardization in evaluating these emotional outcomes.

        <h3>Diegetic vs. Non-Diegetic UI in VR Language Learning</h3>
        <p>
            The results show a clear distinction between diegetic and non-diegetic interfaces in VR environments dedicated to language learning.
            Non-diegetic interfaces, such as menus or HUDs, provide fast access to information and reduce cognitive effort related to explicit information retrieval, but often at the cost of immersion.
            In contrast, diegetic interfaces, embedded directly within the virtual environment, enhance the sense of presence and support contextualized and culturally grounded learning. 
            However, they may reduce the accessibility of certain types of information.
            Recent studies suggest that a hybrid approach, combining diegetic immersion with non-diegetic support, offers the most effective balance between engagement, cognitive load, and pedagogical efficiency.

        <h3>Combined results</h3>
        <p>
            Advances in neural models and large language models enable more natural, context-aware interactions, making AI agents effective as virtual tutors and learning companions.
            Emotional feedback emerges as a key factor in reducing learner anxiety and strengthening motivation and confidence, especially in immersive VR contexts.
            Agents capable of expressing empathy and adaptive encouragement foster deeper engagement, although empirical measurement of emotional impact remains limited.
            In parallel, interface design significantly influences the effectiveness of these agents.
            Non-diegetic interfaces support usability and rapid access to information, while diegetic interfaces enhance immersion and contextual learning.
            The results converge toward hybrid design approaches that combine emotional, conversational, and interface elements to balance engagement, cognitive load, and pedagogical efficiency in VR-based learning systems.
