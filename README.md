## Research Highlights

### 1. Emotional Feedback from AI Agents
- ✅ Reduces learner anxiety
- ✅ Enhances immersion and sense of presence
- ✅ Increases motivation through encouragement
- ✅ Supports multimodal interactions (tone, expressions, gestures)

**Sources**: Pan et al. (2024), Ortega-Ochoa et al. (2024), Dubiel & Botev (2025)

### 2. Conversational AI in Pedagogy
- ✅ Learning outcomes comparable to or better than human tutors
- ✅ Significant increase in learner engagement and participation
- ✅ Enhanced knowledge retention through active dialogue
- ✅ High user satisfaction and technology acceptance

**Sources**: IEEE Xplore, EBSCO, peer-reviewed studies (2023-2025)

### 3. Optimal UI Design for VR
- ✅ **Diegetic UI** maintains immersion and supports transfer learning
- ✅ **Non-diegetic UI** provides essential scaffolding for novice learners
- ✅ **Hybrid approach** optimizes cognitive load management
- ✅ 28% reduction in cognitive effort with diegetic UI

**Framework**: VR-CCL (Virtual Reality - Constructivism and Cognitive Load)
**Sources**: Peixoto et al. (2024), Song et al. (2023)
