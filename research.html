                            Research poster on the subject of conversational agents.
                            The research question is the following: To what extent do conversational AI-based agents affect user engagement and performance in a pedagogical context?
                            Introduction:
                                Based on MondoVR which is a VR platform for language learning that simulates a realistic scenario with NPCs that users speak to.
                                Many studies on conversational agents in collaborative settings, agents as peers or assistants in a group task, but in this case, agent as the tutor itself & main interlocutor.
                                There was a shift before & after surge of genAI: historically, agents were limited, as rule-based scripts / retrieval models, so especially limited in pedagogical value.
                                But nowadays, chatbots have become more advanced with LLMs that can generate dynamic, novel, and contextually coherent responses.
                            Research strategy:
                                Using EBSCO to search in research databases: manually searching for papers using specific keywords and limiting the search to papers released within the last 2 years.
                            Searching on IEEXPlore using command search with the expression: ("conversational agent" AND ("teaching" OR "pedagogical") AND "AI") for papers published within the last 3 years.
                            Results:
                                Neural-based models provided a significant leap in generating refined, context-aware responses & more dynamic conversational interaction with virtual agents, making them more realistic and engaging for users.
                                For education, various use cases, but most of them simulate real-world scenarios.
                                In studies, conversational agents mostly have a female-based appearance (around 50% female only, around 30% male & female).
                                Before generative AI, the critical finding was that conversational agents yield learning outcomes comparable to human tutors, but they affect interactions the most (users are more engaged).
                                How learners perceived the agents: high effectiveness & technology acceptance.
                                Found to increase the frequency of students "sharing their thoughts" & "engaging with each others reasoning".
                                Various pedagogical applications:
                                    Cognitive: where the intents are reflective skills, simulate & experience, tend to be deployed as face-to-face systems.
                                	Instructional: where the intents are mainly mentoring & coaching, for face-to-face education.
                                	Pastoral: where the intents are to motivate & inspire, for distance-education.
